## Features:
Interactive Game Board: The game board displays a grid of words that players can select. The goal is to find groups of four words that belong to the same category.

Tries Counter: The game tracks the number of tries a player has left. Players start with a set number of tries, and the counter decreases with each incorrect selection.

Shuffle and Deselect: Players can shuffle the board to rearrange the words or deselect all selected words with the click of a button.

Modal Dialogs: Informative modal dialogs are used to display messages to the player, such as congratulatory messages or alerts when the player runs out of tries.

Local Storage: The game uses local storage to save the state of the game, including the number of tries left, found words, selected words, and the list of words. This allows the game to persist even if the page is refreshed.

Retry Functionality: Players can restart the game at any time, resetting the tries counter, found words, and selected words.
